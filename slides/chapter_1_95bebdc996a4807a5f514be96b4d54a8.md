Now it's time to make requests to get the data from a response.

We will work primarily with the requests package for creating requests and processing the information from those response. This package simplifies the HTML request & response cycle by wrapping it with Python, allowing us to use Python methods and classes for ease-of-use

## Making a request

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"

`@part1`
```
import requests

api_url="https://stats.nba.com/stats/playergamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlayerID=203076&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2018-19&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision="

request_headers = {

To begin, let's use the NBA Stats free Web API as our starting off point. The NBA Stats is the repository for all the data officially provided by the National Basketball Association. It offers most its data, for free, through a Web API.

let's use the following URL (url). This URL returns the game logs of a particular player with a given set of parameters (like date, season, etc...)

Notice how the URL contains what looks like arguments, such as "DateFrom" & "DateTo", followed by an equal sign and 

What we'll be getting should be the response.
