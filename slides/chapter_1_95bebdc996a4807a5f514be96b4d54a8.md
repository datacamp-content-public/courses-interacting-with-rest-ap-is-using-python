In the last session we looked at what a request looks like and how to find the different requests made by a browser when visiting a particular URL using the Inspect Tool

Now it's time to make requests to get the data from a response.

We will work primarily with the requests package for creating requests and processing the information from those response. This package simplifies the HTML request & response cycle by wrapping it with Python, allowing us to use Python methods and classes for ease-of-use

## Making a request

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d1cf0376e6"
```

`@part1`
```
import requests

api_url="https://stats.nba.com/stats/playergamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlayerID=203076&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2018-19&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision="

request_headers = {
  'User-Agent': 'Mozila/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0',
  'Accept': "application/json",
}

r = requests.get(
        url=api_url,
        headers=request_headers
)

print(r.text)

To begin, let's use the NBA Stats free Web API as our starting off point. The NBA Stats is the repository for all the data officially provided by the National Basketball Association. It offers most of its data, for free, through a Web API.


let's use the following URL (url). This URL allows us to get the game logs of a particular player with a given set of parameters (like date, season, etc). Those arguments are contained within the URL itself. Notice how the URL contains what looks like arguments, such as "DateFrom" & "DateTo", followed by an equal sign and the value assigned to that argument. These arguments are called "query strings" and it's how parameters are assigned a value from the URL. In our particular example, the only relevant arguments are "PlayerID" and "Season". For our example, we're getting the game logs of my favorite NBA player, Anthony Davis who has a PlayerID of 203076, for the 2018-19 regular season.

If you perform a get request on that URL, with the given headers, it will return a json-like response object.
