In the last session we looked at what a request looks like and how to find the different requests made by a browser when visiting a particular URL using the Inspect Tool. Now that you have some working knowledge on how APIs are built into the Web, let's try to get the data ready for analysis.

## The requests package

We will work primarily with the requests package for creating requests and processing the information from those response. This package simplifies the HTML request & response cycle by wrapping it to Python, allowing us to use Python methods and classes for ease-of-use

## Making a request

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d1cf0376e6"
```

`@part1`
```
import requests

api_url="https://stats.nba.com/stats/playergamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlayerID=203076&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2018-19&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision="

request_headers = {
  'User-Agent': 'Mozila/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0',
  'Accept': "application/json",
}

r = requests.get(
        url=api_url,
        headers=request_headers
)

print(r.text)
```

To begin, let's use the NBA Stats free Web API as our starting off point. The NBA Stats website is the repository for all the data officially provided by the National Basketball Association. It offers most of its data, for free, through a Web API.


let's use the following URL (url). This URL allows us to get the game logs of a particular player with a given set of parameters (like date, season, etc). Those arguments are contained within the URL itself. Notice how the URL contains what looks like arguments, such as "DateFrom" & "DateTo", followed by an equal sign and the value assigned to that argument. These arguments are called "query strings" and it's how parameters are assigned a value from the URL. In our particular example, the only relevant arguments are "PlayerID" and "Season". For this particular URL, we're getting the game logs of my favorite NBA player, Anthony Davis who has a PlayerID of 203076, for the 2018-19 regular season.

If you perform a get request on that URL, with the given headers, it will return a json-like response object. This is basically just a long string and it's a bit hard to parse out what data is being returned, so let's format this further.

## Understanding the JSON structure

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "32087a4c99"
```

`@part1`
```
import requests

api_url="https://stats.nba.com/stats/playergamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlayerID=203076&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2018-19&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision="

request_headers = {
  'User-Agent': 'Mozila/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0',
  'Accept': "application/json",
}

r = requests.get(
        url=api_url,
        headers=request_headers
)

with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    file.write(r.text)
    file.close()
```

This is a json like object, and as such, can be outputted as a json. We therefore create a data.json file that contains the response json-like object using the with statement.

We can then read this as a json file, either through whatever channel you prefer. For my case, I usually like to use Firefox to read my json files. You can use other online or offline json readers. If you open the JSON file using Firefox, it will output the json and its structure.

The structure of the json depends on how the API was designed. In this instance, what we're interested in is the rowSet -- which is the data itself, and the headers -- which is the column names.

## From JSON to DataFrame

```yaml

```

`@part1`
```
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd

api_url="https://stats.nba.com/stats/playergamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlayerID=203076&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2018-19&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision="

request_headers = {
  'User-Agent': 'Mozila/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0',
  'Accept': "application/json",
}

r = requests.get(
        url=api_url,
        headers=request_headers
)

raw_data = json.loads(r.text)

data = raw_data['resultSets'][0]['rowSet']
column_names = raw_data['resultSets'][0]['headers']

final_df = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=column_names)
```
